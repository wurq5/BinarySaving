# BinarySaving

Ever wondered how big games save your data efficiently? This project shows you how to handle **binary data saving** in C 

With this example, you'll learn how to:
- Store complex data like structs directly to a file 
- Version your save files for future updates 
- Load data back safely and reliably 

Perfect for game devs curious about **how to store data efficiently** or **implementing a custom file format**

## Features
- Binary file reading/writing
- Save file versioning
- Simple, extendable example code

## Usage
1. Compile the project with your C compiler
2. Run the executable to save or load player data
3. Check out the binary file to see your data in action!

## Why Binary?
Binary files are **faster, smaller, and safer** than text files or jsons when dealing with structured game data. This project gives you a peek into the power of binary data saving
